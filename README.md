# Classic Snake Game
Recreating the classic snake game in Python using Turtle Graphics

**Final game can be found in main.py**

### [Turtle Practice](https://github.com/GabiAnderson/Classic-Snake-Game/tree/main/Turtle%20Practice)
This folder holds a few files where I practiced with different Turtle Graphics concepts.
- [squareTurtlePractice.py](https://github.com/GabiAnderson/Classic-Snake-Game/blob/main/Turtle%20Practice/squareTurtlePractice.py)
  - Implemented a very basic square drawing turtle to get an understanding of how the turtle library works.

- [customTurtlePractice.py](https://github.com/GabiAnderson/Classic-Snake-Game/blob/main/Turtle%20Practice/customTurtlePractice.py)
  - Built upon the previous squareTurtlePractice.py, implementing a custom turtle with a custom shape and color.

- [stamperTurtlePractice.py](https://github.com/GabiAnderson/Classic-Snake-Game/blob/main/Turtle%20Practice/stamperTurtlePractice.py)
  - Extended customTurtlePractice.py, converting the custom turtle from a drawing turtle to a stamping turtle.

- [customAnimationTurtlePractice.py](https://github.com/GabiAnderson/Classic-Snake-Game/blob/main/Turtle%20Practice/customAnimationTurtlePractice.py)
  - Worked with custom animation updates for the custom turtle created earlier.

- [turtleTemplate.py](https://github.com/GabiAnderson/Classic-Snake-Game/blob/main/Turtle%20Practice/turtleTemplate.py)
  - Extracted practice components from stamperTurtlePractice.py to create a template that acted as the starting point for the snake game.

### [Snake Progress](https://github.com/GabiAnderson/Classic-Snake-Game/tree/main/Snake%20Progress)
This folder holds different iterations of my snake game. Each file attempts to tackle a core gameplay element.
- [snakeMoveRightUpdateLook.py](https://github.com/GabiAnderson/Classic-Snake-Game/blob/main/Snake%20Progress/snakeMoveRightUpdateLook.py)
  - Created the snake, drew it on the screen, and got it to move/update properly...

- [controlSnakeMovement.py](https://github.com/GabiAnderson/Classic-Snake-Game/blob/main/Snake%20Progress/controlSnakeMovement.py)
  - Implemented key binds and event handling for controlling the snake's movement.

- [collisionGameLoop.py](https://github.com/GabiAnderson/Classic-Snake-Game/blob/main/Snake%20Progress/collisionGameLoop.py)
  - Overhauled the game loop to handle collision events like snake-on-snake and snake-on-wall interactions.

- [foodSpawnAndCollision.py](https://github.com/GabiAnderson/Classic-Snake-Game/blob/main/Snake%20Progress/foodSpawnAndCollision.py)
  - Implemented food elements in the game and handled food-on-snake collision, enabling the snake to grow by eating food.

- [gameReset.py](https://github.com/GabiAnderson/Classic-Snake-Game/blob/main/Snake%20Progress/gameReset.py)
  - Altered game setup to allow game reset when the player dies without rerunning the application.

- [lambdaMovement.py](https://github.com/GabiAnderson/Classic-Snake-Game/blob/main/Snake%20Progress/lambdaMovement.py)
  - Utilized lambdas for key bindings and event handling to reduce code repetition.

- [main.py](https://github.com/GabiAnderson/Classic-Snake-Game/blob/main/main.py)
  - Final game file, adjusted timings, sizing, colors, etc., for an enjoyable and simple gameplay experience.
