# Classic Snake Game
Found a LinkedIn Learning course that did a brief overview of Turtle Graphics. Thought it would be fun to recreate the classic snake game in Python using Turtle Graphics

## Turtle Practice
Here I will cover the different files found in the folder Turtle Practice.
### squareTurtlePractice.py
Here I implemented a very basic square drawing turtle to get an understanding of how the turtle library works.
### customTurtlePractice.py
Building off my previous squareTurtlePractice.py, I implemented a custom turtle that had a custom shape and color.
### stamperTurtlePractice.py
Building off my customTurtlePractice.py, I turned my custom turtle from a drawing turtle to a stamping turtle.
### customAnimationTurtlePractice.py
Building off my customTurtlePractice.py, I worked with cutom animation updates for my turtle.
### turtleTemplate.py
I took out the practice components from stamperTurtlePractice.py to create this template that acted as my starting point for my snake game.

## Snake Progress
Here I will cover my progress from turtleTemplate.py to my final snake game.
